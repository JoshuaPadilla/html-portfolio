    <p>
        I am Joshua Vincent Padilla, an incoming 3rd year Computer Science student in NorthWest Samar State University
        and I am aspiring to become a fullstack developer and work remotely anywhere in the world. I hope this course will make me one and improve my coding skills. I currently have an idea how simple code works specially in python and java, but I have so many things to learn and I am excited about it.
